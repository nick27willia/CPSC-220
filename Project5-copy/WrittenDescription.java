     // So my program is basically a simple choice based game similar to pokemon
     // or any other game of the sort. It asks the user for a lot of input and 
     // it returns a lot of output. It mainly relys on if statements for conditionals,
     // while loops for battles, an enum and other methods that are called. 
     // The goal is to make it to the end of the code but if you fail the code
     // closes and the end is signified by a congrats method.
     
     // To run the program is simple, compile both project 5 and the Folkemon classes.
     // Then just enter in inputs as prompted. I will provide a sample below.
     
     // Nick
     // two
     // L
     // two
     // two
     // R
     // L
     // two
     // one
     // three
     // two
     // two
     // two
     
     // See all the code is looking for is one word answers that satisfy if or
     // equals statements mainly. There are a few different paths the user can
     // end up on so have fun!
